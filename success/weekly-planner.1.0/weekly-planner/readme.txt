== Description ==

Weekly Planner is a highly customizable plug-in that makes it easy to keep
track of weekly events and display them on your website.  Weekly Planner
features a colorful, easy-to-read display for your readers, along with very 
easy-to-use admin interface that makes it easy to add and remove appointments
while providing maximum flexibility, allowing you to change virtually every 
color without any need to modify the CSS itself.
  
Originally developed for a client who gave private music lessons and wanted 
an easy way to keep her current schedule updated, this plug-in is useful for
anyone who wants to keep a schedule of weekly appointments, such as classes
or tutoring sessions.

Many thanks to Kieran O'Shea (http://www.kieranoshea.com) for his/her
excellent Calendar plug-in, which served as a foundation for this plug-in
from both a technical and design standpoint.
